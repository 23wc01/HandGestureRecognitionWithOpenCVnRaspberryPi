# PiProject
The Hand gesture tracking with openCV and Python pi project is beneficial because it will be able to run commands on the computer with only a hand gesture to the pi camera. This may be beneficial to those who arenâ€™t close to their computers or those who just want a simple hand gesture to quickly run a certain a set of mundane tasks on the computer.
